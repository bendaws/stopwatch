                                Stopwatch
===============================================================================
Basic stopwatch library for Lua.

You can create a new stopwatch object with stopwatch.create(). You can either
call the stopwatch as a function or do stopwatch_obj:start() and
stopwatch_obj:stop() to end the stopwatch.
===============================================================================
Usage Example:

        local stlib = require("stopwatch")
        local stopwatch = stlib.create()

        stopwatch:start() -- or stopwatch() to toggle starting / stopping

        local endAt = os.time() + 3
        repeat until os.time() > endAt

        stopwatch:stop() -- returns integer value of the stopwatch time

        print(tostring(stopwatch)) -- * secs
